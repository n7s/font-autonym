FONTLOG for the Qishtavah font

A font that should render all language autonyms.
Qishtavah means 'In its own script' in Hebrew.

An autonym refers to the way a language is called as well as written in its own script by the actual speakers themselves. 

SIL values and helps every language community. A ethos of service to all means no language ignored or left behind. 

An important use case is an inclusive and bandwith-friendly language selector on a website, web app or desktop/mobile app. 

This font is derived from the Noto Sans open font released under the SIL Open Font License.

Proofs are provided along with a demo webpage making use of the font.
